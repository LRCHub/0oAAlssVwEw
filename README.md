[00:28.03] I should have known
[00:37.53] 
[00:34.76] I'd leave alone
[00:41.55] Just goes to show
[00:46.75] That the blood you bleed
[00:49.00] Is just the blood you owe
[01:01.50] 
[00:55.26] We were a pair
[01:01.60] But I saw you there
[01:08.50] Too much to bear
[01:13.16] You were my life, but life is far away from fair
[01:37.16] 
[01:20.09] Was I stupid to love you?
[01:23.77] Was I reckless to help?
[01:27.42] Was it obvious to everybody else?
[01:43.92] 
[01:33.92] That I'd fallen for a lie
[01:40.57] You were never on my side
[01:47.36] Fool me once, fool me twice
[01:50.54] Are you death or paradise?
[01:54.16] Now you'll never see me cry
[01:59.31] There's just no time to die
[02:12.81] 
[02:15.67] I let it burn
[02:22.19] You're no longer my concern, mmm
[02:28.97] Faces from my past return
[02:33.66] Another lesson yet to learn
[02:47.16] 
[02:40.73] That I'd fallen for a lie
[02:47.24] You were never on my side
[02:53.90] Fool me once, fool me twice
[02:57.28] Are you death or paradise?
[03:00.94] Now you'll never see me cry
[03:06.09] There's just no time to die
[03:19.59] 
[03:13.53] No time to die, mmm
[03:20.48] No time to die, ooh
[03:29.98] 
[03:34.01] Fool me once, fool me twice
[03:37.56] Are you death or paradise?
[03:41.05] Now you'll never see me cry
[03:46.56] There's just no time to die
